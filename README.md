# etk.me

This is my personal website, done in [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll "Jekyll") with [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ "Twitter Bootstrap").

Eventually, it'll be at [etk.me](http://etk.me "etk.me"), once I finish ripping out the bloated and unnecessarily complicated Expression Engine setup that currently lives there.

Anyway.  In the meantime, let the static site awesomeness begin!  Rock!
